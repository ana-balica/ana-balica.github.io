Early on when [DjangoCon Europe 2015](http://2015.djangocon.eu/) was announced,
it instantly differentiated itself from other conferences.

Organized this year in Cardiff, UK, DjangoCon
set its goals high by planning 3 days of talks, 2 days of sprints and providing
inclusive environment for everybody. It encouraged first time speakers to come
and share their thoughts and adventures in Djangoland (&copy; [@bmispelon](https://twitter.com/bmispelon)) by
launching a speaker mentor program, included a live text transcription throughout the whole
conference, offered a free crèche (and we had some lovely young djangonaughts),
organized a free open day, which students of Cardiff University benefited from.

In addition to all of this DjangoCon is characterized by an extremely friendly
community. Mark said it better:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can honestly say that the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/djangocon?src=hash">#djangocon</a> community is the nicest, most decent collection of people I have ever met. Breath-takingly lovely ❤️</p>&mdash; Mark Henwood (@mcbhenwood) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcbhenwood/status/606150799270539265">June 3, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

During those few days spent in Cardiff, you realize that Django is not just a
framework that we all use and like, it's the people who
make it awesome. It's also sort of snowball effect. Once you see how Django
community treats all the newcomers, you want to share this right attitude
with the rest of the world.

DjangoCon did everything right. And it's pretty hard to get everything right
when you have 300+ attendees, volunteer-driven team (actually the most pony-awesome team:
Vincent, Baptiste, David, Daniele, Ola, Jason, Geraint) and
[One Direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJO3ROT-A4E) invasion.
