My last blogpost was published on [November 11th 2017](http://ana-balica.github.io/2017/11/11/python-mutable-vs-immutable/),
which would make it over half a year old.

I don't think the reason for my writing blackout was general busyness of life.
Yes, I did transition into a new role and I've taken on new challenges,
but if I wanted to write something, I would have done so regardless of time constraints.

Truth is I have a backlog of article ideas. I look over them every Sunday during the review of my TODO list.
Something stops me from elaborating on any of them and uploading them here.

A recent short discussion made me think should one post for the sake of keeping themselves going
or should one filter and invest in writing only when there's something worth of sharing.

What I struggle with most is that if it's not something that I have wrestled with, and
spend a lot of time on it, or invested myself directly into it, I don't feel like I have
the permission to talk about it.

There are different types of posts. I could write more stuff about Python and Django,
very specific technologies that I have experience with, but because I swim in this day by day,
I don't find any of it all that interesting or innovative to talk about.
Moreover considering there are so many other excellent resources on the internet,
I'm gonna be yet another lost voice repeating the stuff that's already known.

Then there's the stuff I have spent more time on, for example my posts about Datastore indexes
([[1]](http://ana-balica.github.io/2016/11/20/datastore-indexes-basics/) & [[2]](http://ana-balica.github.io/2016/11/28/intricacies-and-optimization-of-datastore-indexes/)).
I honestly don't think anyone will ever read this, because it's such a niche thing.
But because I paved my own path to understanding and figuring out some tips and tricks by myself,
I feel like I'm genuine when I talk about it.

I thought I want to write about the nature of bugs in software.
Working titles: "Embrace your bugs", "We all have bugs", "Bugs: let them be".
I can trace the idea back to this book: [Turn the ship around](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Turn-Ship-Around-Building-Breaking/dp/1591846404)
by L. David Marquet.

I'll give you the gist: strive for excellence, don't focus on avoiding mistakes.
If mistakes is all you care about, dodging bugs will drain all you time and energy.
And bugs happen all the time. See what lies beyond and aim for excellence.

I read the book by the recommendation of my manager. This idea from the book is not original.
But because I know the source of the idea and the way I came to is certainly not original,
I grapple taking the bugs blogpost any further.

Quite often when I write, I feel not like an imposter, but like a thief.
I read, listen, compile, reshape, put it in a pretty box and present it to others.

This is why I haven't been writing.
