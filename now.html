  <ul class="now-list">
      <li>Currently working as a contract backend developer for <a href='https://p.ota.to' target='_blank'>Potato</a> in London.</li>
      <li>Gave my talk about HTTP history and performance at <a href="http://2017.render-conf.com/talks#ana-balica">RenderConf 2017</a> in Oxford, UK. <em>(30 minutes was indeed not enough).</em> 
          The feedback was good, but I think the takeaway wasn't very clear. So either the talk needs an update, or I won't recycle it at all. </li>
      <li>Thinking about joining <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a>.</li>
      <li>Becoming a regular at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/">PyLadies London</a> meetup.</li>
      <li>Favourite podcasts: <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a> and <a href="http://loveandradio.org/">Love+Radio</a>.</li>
      <li>Planning to attend EuroPython this year.</li>
